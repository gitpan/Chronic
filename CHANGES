0.20 (June 30, 2004)

    - SIGHUP handling was introduced in chronicd. On receipt of
      a HUP signal, chronicd will drop the existing schedule,
      re-read config files and start over again.

    - Capability to run certain tasks "only once" was added
      to the Scheduler. When ``only_once'' is set to 1 in
      the config file, chronicd will run the task once.
      chronicd will purge these tasks from the chrontab once
      they've been run.

    - Notification functionality augmented to inform the user of
      failures. If return value of the program is not 0, a
      failure is assumed.


0.15 (June 04, 2004) 

    - Introduced the "InXs" constraint that combines the
      Inactivity constraint and the Xscreensaver constraint
      using an OR relationship.

    - Scheduler wait doesn't exceed 10 minutes. This is because
      a machine can hibernate (or chronicd backgrounded) in
      middle of a long sleep, causing scheduler_wait to exceed
      the intended sleep time. An upper limit ensure that
      chronicd will "self-correct" its timers every 10 minutes.

    - Added support for email notifications. notify =
      email@address as a task field will send notifications to
      email@address. Time values in the email notification are
      in human readable format. eg. 35 seconds, 4.52 days, etc. 
      [Feature Request 946816]

    - Fixed a bug in chrontab re-writing logic. We were missing
      the final ";" which could've caused a corrupted chrontab
      in certain cases.

    - Added a template constraint module under the docs
      directory. The template will act as a starting point for
      writing new constraints.


0.10 (May 15, 2004)

    - Introduced a Xscreensaver constraint that is met when
      Xscreensaver is locked for a specified amount of time.
      chonicd manpage updated with Xscreensaver documentation.
      [Feature Request #952966]

    - Added a basic use test to satisfy CPAN's automated
      testing. A more comprehensive test suite will be
      provided someday.


0.02 (May 11, 2004)

    - First public release.
